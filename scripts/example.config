[hidden states]
# The hidden states for this model. You can directly specify them via:
#    hidden states: [0, h_1, ..., h_M]
# Alternatively, you can set
#    M:  20
#    h_M: 10.0
# resulting in hidden states equaling the 20 quantiles of the
# exponential distribution on the interval [0, M).
M: 64
h_M: 14.0

[model parameters]
# Should we fit a piecewise exponential or piecewise constant model?
# Note that selecting piecewise exponential doubles the amount of
# parameters to be fitted.
piecewise exponential: True

# The model will be piecewise defined with break points
#    0 = t_0 < t_1 < ... < t_K < \infty
# As with the hidden states, you can either set the vector t
# directly, or specify K and t_K for log-uniform spacing.
ts = [0., 0.002   ,  0.008   ,  0.021   ,  0.13    ,  0.23    ,  2.      ,  2.1]
# K: 10
# t_1 = 0.002
