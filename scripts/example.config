[hidden states]
# The hidden states for this model. You can directly specify them via:
#    hidden states: [0, h_1, ..., h_M]
# Alternatively, you can set
# resulting in hidden states equaling the 20 quantiles of the
# exponential distribution on the interval [0, M).
M: 40
h_M: 14.9

[model parameters]
# Should we fit a piecewise exponential or piecewise constant model?
# Note that selecting piecewise exponential doubles the amount of
# parameters to be fitted.
exponential pieces: [0]

# The model will be piecewise defined with break points
#    0 = t_0 < t_1 < ... < t_K < \infty
# As with the hidden states, you can either set the vector t
# directly, or specify K and t_K for log-uniform spacing.
K: 6+2*3+30*1
t_1 = 0.002
t_K = 2.2
